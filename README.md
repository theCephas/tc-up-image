### Image Gallery with Drag and Drop Feature

This is a simple project that displays several animal images. The user can drag images and reorder them to suit tastes. This project is also my task 3 project - HNG INTERNSHIP.

Also, users have the liberty to register with their email and password. However, choosing not to register is not a bad choice since there is a default log in provided:

Email: user@example.com
Password: 1Password

## Built with:

1. Reactjs + Vite
2. Tailwindcss
3. React-beautiful-dnd
4. Pixabay API

Have a good feel!ðŸš€
